# ngrok-samples-go
This repository is currently a work in progress. I'm gathering simple code samples that I'm writig as I learn [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). I'm using the automated emails you receive after creating an account as a general guide. Eventually, I'll organize the code to possibly match the emails. But, for now, this simple a spot where I'm storing my bits of code. Feel free to peruse and offer feedback in the issues if you wish.
